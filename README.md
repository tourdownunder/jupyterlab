An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.  [Currently in beta.](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)

[JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). It offers
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user inteface.
Eventually, JupyterLab will replace the classic Jupyter Notebook after
JupyterLab reaches 1.0.

JupyterLab can be extended using extensions that are [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
and use our public APIs. You can search for the GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension) to find extensions. To learn more about extensions, see our  [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html).

The beta releases are suitable for general
usage. For JupyterLab extension developers, the extension APIs will continue to
evolve until the 1.0 release.

## Getting started

### Installation

You can [install](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) JupyterLab using `conda`, `pip`, or `pipenv`.

Instructions on how to install the project from the git sources are available in our [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### conda

If you use ``conda``, you can install as:


```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

#### pip

If you use ``pip``, you can install it as:


```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level
 `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch
 `jupyter lab`.

#### pipenv

If you use ``pipenv``, you can install it as:

```bash
pipenv install jupyterlab
pipenv shell
```

or from a git checkout:

```bash
pipenv install git+git://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git#egg=jupyterlab
pipenv shell
```

When using ``pipenv``, in order to launch `jupyter lab`, you must activate the project's virtualenv. For example, in the directory where ``pipenv``'s `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` live (i.e., where you ran the above commands):

```bash
pipenv shell
jupyter lab
```

#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook

If you are using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, then you must also run the following command
after installation to enable the JupyterLab server extension:

```bash
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix
```

### Running

Start up JupyterLab using:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser. See our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.

### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers

Jupyter notebook version 4.3 or later. To check the notebook version:

```bash
jupyter notebook --version
```
The latest versions of the following browsers are currently *known to work*:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari

See our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.
